libsass: SASS_ for Python
=========================

This package provides a simple Python extension module ``sass`` which is
binding Libsass_ (written in C/C++ by Hampton Catlin and Aaron Leung).
It's very straightforward and there isn't any headache related Python
distribution/deployment.  That means you can add just ``libsass`` into
your ``setup.py``'s ``install_requires`` list or ``requirements.txt`` file.
Need no Ruby nor Node.js.

It currently supports CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and PyPy 1.9+!
